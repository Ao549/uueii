$ git add my/changed/files
$ git commit
$ git push origin my-branch
It is also frequently necessary to synchronize your Pull Request with other changes that have landed in master by using git rebase:

$ git fetch --all
$ git rebase upstream/master
$ git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
Important: The git push --force-with-lease command is one of the few ways to delete history in git. Before you use it, make sure you understand the risks. If in doubt, you can always ask for guidance in the Pull Request.

If you happen to make a mistake in any of your commits, do not worry. You can amend the last commit (for example if you want to change the commit log).

$ git add any/changed/files
$ git commit --amend
$ git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
There are a number of more advanced mechanisms for managing commits using git rebase that can be used, but are beyond the scope of this guide.

Feel free to post a comment in the Pull Request to ping reviewers if you are awaiting an answer on something. If you encounter words or acronyms that seem unfamiliar, refer to this glossary.
